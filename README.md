JuliaGeo is an organization that contains a number of related Julia projects for manipulating, querying, and processing geospatial geometry data. This repository is set up for discussion centered around the JuliaGeo organization, and lists some of the existing libraries available, as well as ways to get involved in the JuliaGeo ecosystem (packages, educational material, and more).

You might be interested in [the geo channel on the discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/geo), where we ask questions and discuss progress on geo-related Julia packages.
