JuliaGeo is an organization that contains a number of related Julia projects for manipulating, querying, and processing geospatial geometry data. This repository is set up for discussion centered around the JuliaGeo organization, and lists some of the [existing libraries](ExistingLibraries.md) available, as well as ways to [get involved](GettingInvolved.md) in the JuliaGeo ecosystem (packages, educational material, and more).

You might be interested in [the geo channel on the discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/geo), where we ask questions and discuss progress on geo-related Julia packages.
